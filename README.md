## Simulated annealing

### Jupyter Notebooks

The project includes Jupyter notebooks for interactive development and analysis:

- `simulated_anneling/GL_Jax.ipynb`: A notebook implementing the Ginzburg-Landau equation solver using JAX for automatic differentiation and optimization. This notebook contains the implementation of simulated annealing algorithms for finding ground state solutions.

To run the notebooks:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyter`)
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter server
4. Open the desired notebook in your browser
